# DemoProject
something not important

If you clone my project firstly, you may generate .iml file in sub project with idea,
but no DemoProject.iml, because idea does't find your 'src' dir in your root dir.

Don't worry! I find a solution for you, and so easy:  
Copy another XXX.iml to your root dir and reopen your idea!
